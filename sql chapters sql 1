-- Basic SELECT Statement syntax
SELECT  *|{[DISTINCT] column [alias],...} 
FROM    table;
/* A SELECT clause, which specifies the columns to be displayed 
â€¢ A FROM clause, which identifies the table containing the columns that are listed in the SELECT clause 

In the syntax: 
SELECT Is a list of one or more columns 
* Selects all columns 
DISTINCT Suppresses duplicates 
column|expression Selects the named column or the expression
alias Gives different headings to the selected columns
FROM table Specifies the table containing the columns*/

SELECT * FROM   departments;

-- You can also display all columns in the table by listing them after the SELECT keyword. 
-- For example, the following SQL statement (like the example in the slide) displays all columns and all rows of the DEPARTMENTS table: 
SELECT  department_id, department_name, manager_id, location_id 
FROM    departments; 


-- Selecting Specific Columns
SELECT department_id, location_id 
FROM   departments;

-- to display location before department number (from left to right), you use the following statement:
SELECT location_id, department_id 
FROM   departments 6;

--  column headings are displayed in uppercase and are left-aligned.
SELECT last_name, hire_date, salary 
FROM   employees;
-- Using Arithmetic Operators
SELECT last_name, salary, salary + 300 
FROM   employees;
-- Operator Precedence
SELECT last_name, salary, 12*(salary+100)
FROM   employees;

SELECT last_name, salary, 12*salary+100 
FROM   employees;
-- e parentheses to reinforce the standard order of precedence and to improve clarity. For example, the expression in the slide can be written as (12*salary)+100 with no change in the result. 
-- Using Parentheses You can override the rules of precedence by using parentheses to specify the desired order in which the operators are to be executed. 

--  Null is not the same as zero or a blank space.
SELECT last_name, job_id, salary, commission_pct FROM   employees;

last_name, 12*salary*commission_pct FROM   employees;
