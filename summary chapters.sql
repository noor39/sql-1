-- chapter 4 focuses on **using single-row functions to customize output**. 
-- These functions are used to manipulate data values, perform calculations, 
-- modify data items and the output for groups of rows, and format dates and numbers. 
-- The chapter covers character, number, and date functions.

Key aspects of this chapter include:

*   **SQL Functions**: There are two types of SQL functions: single-row and group functions.
*   **Single-Row Functions**: Single-row functions return one result per row.
*   **Character Functions**: These include case-conversion functions (LOWER, UPPER, INITCAP) 
and character-manipulation functions (CONCAT, SUBSTR, LENGTH, INSTR, LPAD, RPAD, TRIM, REPLACE).
    *   **Case-Conversion Functions**: LOWER converts to lowercase, UPPER to uppercase, 
    and INITCAP to initial capital case.
    *   **Character-Manipulation Functions**: Functions such as CONCAT, SUBSTR, and LENGTH 
    manipulate character strings.
*   **Numeric Functions**: Numeric functions accept numeric input and return numeric values. 
The chapter mentions ROUND, TRUNC, and MOD.
*   **Working with Dates**: Includes using the SYSDATE, CURRENT_DATE, and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP functions,
 and performing arithmetic with dates.
*   **Date Functions**: These functions manipulate date values. The chapter also discusses using ROUND 
and TRUNC with dates.
*   **Nesting Functions**: Results are evaluated from the innermost to the outermost function.

Important considerations regarding functions:

*   SQL functions can accept arguments that are a column or an expression.
*   SQL functions can be nested.
*   SQL functions never modify the data type.

    CASE expression.
    *   **DECODE Function**: The DECODE function is another way to express conditional logic, similar to the 
    CASE expression.


    Chapter 5 is about **customizing SQL queries using conversion functions and conditional expressions** [Me].
    It provides ways to manipulate and present data in a more meaningful format.

**Conversion Functions** [5-4, 30, Me]

*   These functions convert data from one data type to another [30, Me]. This is useful when you need to perform 
operations or comparisons between different data types [30, Me].
*   The source presents several conversion functions [5-6, Me]:
    *   **TO\_CHAR(date, \[fmt], \[nlsparams])**: This converts a date to a character string, allowing you 
    to format the date in various ways [5-8, Me].
    *   **TO\_CHAR(number, \[fmt], \[nlsparams])**: This converts a number to a character string, which is
     helpful for formatting numbers with specific decimal places, currency symbols, or other formatting
      elements [5-10, Me].

-- -- SIR QUES
-- Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, here are the answers to your questions 
-- regarding SQL functions, group functions, and related concepts from Chapters 4 and 5:

-- **What are SQL Functions?**

SQL functions are a powerful feature of SQL that are used to manipulate data values. They can perform 
calculations on data, modify individual data items, manipulate output for groups of rows, format dates
 and numbers for display, and convert column data types. SQL functions may take arguments and always return a value.

-- **Types of SQL Functions**

There are two main types of SQL functions:

*   **Single-row functions**: These functions operate on single rows and return one result per row.
*   **Multiple-row functions (Group functions)**: These functions manipulate groups of rows to give one
 result per group of rows.

-- **Classifications of Single-Row Functions (Chapters 4 and 5)**



-- *   **Chapter 4**:
--     *   **Character Functions**: Accept character input and can return both character and number values.
        *   **Case-Conversion Functions**:
            *   LOWER(column|expression): Converts alpha character values to lowercase.
            *   UPPER(column|expression): Converts alpha character values to uppercase.
            *   INITCAP(column|expression): Converts alpha character values to uppercase 
            for the first letter of each word; all other letters in lowercase.
        *   **Character-Manipulation Functions**:
            *   CONCAT: Joins values together (limited to two parameters).
            *   SUBSTR: Extracts a string of determined length.
            *   LENGTH: Returns the length of a string.

            *   LPAD: Pads the left side of a value with a specific character.
            *   RPAD: Pads the right side of a value with a specific character.
            *   TRIM: Trims characters from the beginning or end of a string.
            *   REPLACE: Replaces a sequence of characters in a string with another set of characters.
--     *   **Numeric Functions**: Accept numeric input and return numeric values. Examples from the source include:
        *   ROUND(column|expression, n): Rounds the value to *n* decimal places.
        *   TRUNC(column|expression, n): Truncates the value to *n* decimal places.
        *   MOD(m,n): Returns the remainder of m divided by n.
--     *   **Date Functions**: Operate on values of the DATE data type. Examples from the source include:
        *   SYSDATE: Returns the current system date.
        *   CURRENT\_DATE: Returns the current date in the session time zone.
        *   CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP: Returns the current timestamp in the session time zone.
-- *   **Chapter 5**:
--     *   **Conversion Functions**: Convert a value from one data type to another.
        *   TO\_CHAR(date, \[fmt], \[nlsparams]): Converts a date to a string with a specified format.
        *   TO\_CHAR(number, \[fmt], \[nlsparams]): Converts a number to a string with a specified format.
        *   TO\_NUMBER(char, \[fmt], \[nlsparams]): Converts a character string to a number.
        *   TO\_DATE(char, \[fmt], \[nlsparams]): Converts a character string to a date.
--     *   **General Functions**: Can handle NULLs and work with any data type.
        *   NVL(expression1, expression2): Converts a null value to an actual value. If *expression1* is null,
         it returns *expression2*.
        *   NVL2(expression1, expression2, expression3): If *expression1* is not null, NVL2 returns *expression2*. 
        If *expression1* is null, NVL2 returns *expression3*.
        *   NULLIF(expression1, expression2): Compares two expressions. If they are equal, the function returns NULL.
         If they are not equal, the function returns the first expression.
        *   COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ..., expression_n): Returns the first non-null expression in the list.
--     *   **Conditional Expressions**: Provide IF-THEN-ELSE logic within a SQL statement.
        *   CASE expression: Allows IF-THEN-ELSE logic in SQL statements.
        *   Searched CASE expression.
        *   DECODE function: Oracle-specific function similar to CASE for conditional logic.

-- **What are the types of Group functions?**

-- Group functions include:

*   AVG: Returns the average value.
*   COUNT: Returns the number of rows.
*   MAX: Returns the maximum value.
*   MIN: Returns the minimum value.
*   SUM: Returns the sum of values.
*   LISTAGG
*   STDDEV
*   VARIANCE

-- **Illegal Queries Using Group Functions**

When using the `GROUP BY` clause, all columns in the `SELECT` list that are not group functions must be included in the
 `GROUP BY` clause.

**When do you use the HAVING clause?**

The `HAVING` clause is used to restrict group results based on a specified condition. It is used to filter groups 
after the `GROUP BY` clause has been applied.

-- **Guidelines for Group Functions**

-- Here are some guidelines for using group functions:

*   `DISTINCT` makes the function consider only nonduplicate values; `ALL` considers every value, including duplicates.
 The default is `ALL`.
*   Data types for functions with an `expr` argument may be CHAR, VARCHAR2, NUMBER, or DATE.
*   Group functions ignore null values. Use `NVL`, `NVL2`, `COALESCE`, `CASE`, or `DECODE` to substitute values for
 nulls.
*   When using the `GROUP BY` clause, include all non-group function columns from the `SELECT` list in the `GROUP BY`
 clause.
*   The `HAVING` clause is used to filter group results.
*   Group functions can be nested to a depth of two functions, and the `GROUP BY` clause is mandatory when nesting
 group functions.
*   You cannot use a column alias in the `GROUP BY` clause.
*   By using a `WHERE` clause, you can exclude rows before dividing them into groups.
*   Place the `HAVING` and `GROUP BY` clauses after the `WHERE` clause in a statement. Place the `ORDER BY` 
clause at the end.
