-- chapter 4 focuses on **using single-row functions to customize output**. 
-- These functions are used to manipulate data values, perform calculations, 
-- modify data items and the output for groups of rows, and format dates and numbers. 
-- The chapter covers character, number, and date functions.

Key aspects of this chapter include:

*   **SQL Functions**: There are two types of SQL functions: single-row and group functions.
*   **Single-Row Functions**: Single-row functions return one result per row.
*   **Character Functions**: These include case-conversion functions (LOWER, UPPER, INITCAP) 
and character-manipulation functions (CONCAT, SUBSTR, LENGTH, INSTR, LPAD, RPAD, TRIM, REPLACE).
    *   **Case-Conversion Functions**: LOWER converts to lowercase, UPPER to uppercase, 
    and INITCAP to initial capital case.
    *   **Character-Manipulation Functions**: Functions such as CONCAT, SUBSTR, and LENGTH 
    manipulate character strings.
*   **Numeric Functions**: Numeric functions accept numeric input and return numeric values. 
The chapter mentions ROUND, TRUNC, and MOD.
*   **Working with Dates**: Includes using the SYSDATE, CURRENT_DATE, and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP functions,
 and performing arithmetic with dates.
*   **Date Functions**: These functions manipulate date values. The chapter also discusses using ROUND 
and TRUNC with dates.
*   **Nesting Functions**: Results are evaluated from the innermost to the outermost function.

Important considerations regarding functions:

*   SQL functions can accept arguments that are a column or an expression.
*   SQL functions can be nested.
*   SQL functions never modify the data type.

    based on those conditions. There are two types of CASE expressions: the CASE function and the SEARCHED 
    CASE expression.
    *   **DECODE Function**: The DECODE function is another way to express conditional logic, similar to the 
    CASE expression.


    Chapter 5 is about **customizing SQL queries using conversion functions and conditional expressions** [Me].
    It provides ways to manipulate and present data in a more meaningful format.

**Conversion Functions** [5-4, 30, Me]

*   These functions convert data from one data type to another [30, Me]. This is useful when you need to perform 
operations or comparisons between different data types [30, Me].
*   The source presents several conversion functions [5-6, Me]:

*   These functions include [5-18, Me]:
    *   **NVL(expression1, expression2)**: If *expression1* is null, it returns *expression2* [87, Me]. 
    This is useful for substituting a default value when a column contains a NULL [87, Me].
    *   **NVL2(expression1, expression2, expression3)**: If *expression1* is not null, NVL2 returns *expression2*.
     If *expression1* is null, NVL2 returns *expression3* [87, Me].
    *   **NULLIF(expression1, expression2)**: If *expression1* equals *expression2*, the function returns NULL. 
    If they are not equal, the function returns *expression1* [87, Me].

     based on those conditions [30, 34, 35, Me].
    *   **Searched CASE Expression**: An extension of the CASE expression that allows 
    for more complex conditions [30, 35, Me].
    *   **DECODE Function**: An Oracle-specific function similar to CASE for conditional logic [30, 36, Me].


-- -- SIR QUES
-- Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, here are the answers to your questions 
-- regarding SQL functions, group functions, and related concepts from Chapters 4 and 5:

-- **What are SQL Functions?**

SQL functions are a powerful feature of SQL that are used to manipulate data values. They can perform 
calculations on data, modify individual data items, manipulate output for groups of rows, format dates
 and numbers for display, and convert column data types. SQL functions may take arguments and always return a value.

-- **Types of SQL Functions**

There are two main types of SQL functions:

*   **Single-row functions**: These functions operate on single rows and return one result per row.
*   **Multiple-row functions (Group functions)**: These functions manipulate groups of rows to give one
 result per group of rows.

-- **Classifications of Single-Row Functions (Chapters 4 and 5)**



-- *   **Chapter 4**:
--     *   **Character Functions**: Accept character input and can return both character and number values.
        *   **Case-Conversion Functions**:
            *   LOWER(column|expression): Converts alpha character values to lowercase.
            *   UPPER(column|expression): Converts alpha character values to uppercase.
            *   INITCAP(column|expression): Converts alpha character values to uppercase 
            for the first letter of each word; all other letters in lowercase.
        *   **Character-Manipulation Functions**:
            *   CONCAT: Joins values together (limited to two parameters).
            *   SUBSTR: Extracts a string of determined length.
            *   LENGTH: Returns the length of a string.
            *   INSTR: Finds the numeric position of a named character.
            *   LPAD: Pads the left side of a value with a specific character.
            *   RPAD: Pads the right side of a value with a specific character.
            *   TRIM: Trims characters from the beginning or end of a string.
            *   REPLACE: Replaces a sequence of characters in a string with another set of characters.
--     *   **Numeric Functions**: Accept numeric input and return numeric values. Examples from the source include:
        *   ROUND(column|expression, n): Rounds the value to *n* decimal places.
        *   TRUNC(column|expression, n): Truncates the value to *n* decimal places.
        *   MOD(m,n): Returns the remainder of m divided by n.
--     *   **Date Functions**: Operate on values of the DATE data type. Examples from the source include:
        *   SYSDATE: Returns the current system date.
        *   CURRENT\_DATE: Returns the current date in the session time zone.
        *   CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP: Returns the current timestamp in the session time zone.
-- *   **Chapter 5**:
--     *   **Conversion Functions**: Convert a value from one data type to another.
        *   TO\_CHAR(date, \[fmt], \[nlsparams]): Converts a date to a string with a specified format.
        *   TO\_CHAR(number, \[fmt], \[nlsparams]): Converts a number to a string with a specified format.
        *   TO\_NUMBER(char, \[fmt], \[nlsparams]): Converts a character string to a number.
        *   TO\_DATE(char, \[fmt], \[nlsparams]): Converts a character string to a date.
--     *   **General Functions**: Can handle NULLs and work with any data type.
        *   NVL(expression1, expression2): Converts a null value to an actual value. If *expression1* is null,
         it returns *expression2*.
        *   NVL2(expression1, expression2, expression3): If *expression1* is not null, NVL2 returns *expression2*. 
        If *expression1* is null, NVL2 returns *expression3*.
        *   NULLIF(expression1, expression2): Compares two expressions. If they are equal, the function returns NULL.
         If they are not equal, the function returns the first expression.
        *   COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ..., expression_n): Returns the first non-null expression in the list.
--     *   **Conditional Expressions**: Provide IF-THEN-ELSE logic within a SQL statement.
        *   CASE expression: Allows IF-THEN-ELSE logic in SQL statements.
        *   Searched CASE expression.
        *   DECODE function: Oracle-specific function similar to CASE for conditional logic.

-- **What are the types of Group functions?**

-- Group functions include:

*   AVG: Returns the average value.
*   COUNT: Returns the number of rows.
*   MAX: Returns the maximum value.
*   MIN: Returns the minimum value.
*   SUM: Returns the sum of values.
*   LISTAGG
*   STDDEV
*   VARIANCE

-- **Illegal Queries Using Group Functions**

When using the `GROUP BY` clause, all columns in the `SELECT` list that are not group functions must be included in the
 `GROUP BY` clause.

**When do you use the HAVING clause?**

The `HAVING` clause is used to restrict group results based on a specified condition. It is used to filter groups 
after the `GROUP BY` clause has been applied.

-- **Guidelines for Group Functions**

-- Here are some guidelines for using group functions:

*   `DISTINCT` makes the function consider only nonduplicate values; `ALL` considers every value, including duplicates.
 The default is `ALL`.
*   Data types for functions with an `expr` argument may be CHAR, VARCHAR2, NUMBER, or DATE.
*   Group functions ignore null values. Use `NVL`, `NVL2`, `COALESCE`, `CASE`, or `DECODE` to substitute values for
 nulls.
*   When using the `GROUP BY` clause, include all non-group function columns from the `SELECT` list in the `GROUP BY`
 clause.
*   The `HAVING` clause is used to filter group results.
*   Group functions can be nested to a depth of two functions, and the `GROUP BY` clause is mandatory when nesting
 group functions.
*   You cannot use a column alias in the `GROUP BY` clause.
*   By using a `WHERE` clause, you can exclude rows before dividing them into groups.
*   Place the `HAVING` and `GROUP BY` clauses after the `WHERE` clause in a statement. Place the `ORDER BY` 
clause at the end.

SELECT  *|{[DISTINCT] column [alias],...} 
FROM    table;
/* A SELECT clause, which specifies the columns to be displayed 
• A FROM clause, which identifies the table containing the columns that are listed in the SELECT clause 

In the syntax: 
SELECT Is a list of one or more columns 
* Selects all columns 
DISTINCT Suppresses duplicates 
column|expression Selects the named column or the expression
alias Gives different headings to the selected columns
FROM table Specifies the table containing the columns*/

SELECT * FROM   departments;

-- You can also display all columns in the table by listing them after the SELECT keyword. 
-- For example, the following SQL statement (like the example in the slide) displays all columns and all rows of the DEPARTMENTS table: 
SELECT  department_id, department_name, manager_id, location_id 
FROM    departments; 


-- Selecting Specific Columns
SELECT department_id, location_id 
FROM   departments;

-- to display location before department number (from left to right), you use the following statement:
SELECT location_id, department_id 
FROM   departments 6;

--  column headings are displayed in uppercase and are left-aligned.
SELECT last_name, hire_date, salary 
FROM   employees;
-- Using Arithmetic Operators
SELECT last_name, salary, salary + 300

FROM   employees;

SELECT last_name, salary, 12*salary+100

-- e parentheses to reinforce the standard order of precedence and to improve clarity. For example, the expression in the slide can be written as (12*salary)+100 with no change in the result. 
-- Using Parentheses You can override the rules of precedence by using parentheses to specify the desired order in which the operators are to be executed. 

--  Null is not the same as zero or a blank space.

**Explanations for Key Answers:**

- **Question 14:** Views with pseudocolumns (e.g., `ROWNUM`) restrict DML operations. While both **Insert** and **Update** are invalid, the closest single answer is **Update** due to the options provided.  
- **Question 17:** Indexes are useful for expressions (function-based indexes), even if other scenarios (e.g., frequent table updates) might not be ideal.  
- **Question 21:** Sequences generate unique numbers (A) and are used for primary keys (C).  

**Formatting Note:** The answers are concise and directly address each question. For clarity, ambiguous questions (e.g., Q14) include a brief explanation.




<!-- ashik -->

1. A function based index holds an expression. The express can be develop from: O Table Columns
Constraints
Built in functions
User-defined functions
All of above
2. In Sequence, what returns the next available sequence value.
Views Sequences Nextval
O Currval
3. Indexes must be created manually and serve to speed up access to rows in a table.
True
False
4. A public synonym and a private synonym can exist with the same name for the same table.
O True
False


5. Which constraint can be defines only at the column level?
OUNIQUE
ONOT NULL
O CHECK
PRIMARY KEY
6. What is true about sequences?
Once created, a sequence is linked to a specific table.
Once created, a sequence is automatically available to all users. Once created, a sequence belongs to a specific schema. Only the DBA can control which sequence is used by a certain table.
7. What is true about sequences?
O The start value of the sequence is always 1.
OA sequence always increments by 1.
The minimum value of an ascending sequence defaults to 1.
The maximum value of descending sequence defaults to 1.
8. Examine the statement:
Create
synonym EMP for hr.employees;
What happens when you issue the statement?
An error is generated.
You will have two identical tables in the HR schema with different names.
You create a table called employees in the HR schema based on your EMP table.
You create an alternative name for the employees table in the HR schema in your own schema

**Key Explanations:**

- **Question 1:** While constraints are not part of index expressions, the options may incorrectly include "All of the above." The intended answer likely assumes columns, built-in, and user-defined functions are valid.  
- **Question 7:** The default minimum for ascending sequences is 1.  
- **Question 13:** Sequences can generate foreign key values if they reference valid primary keys.  
- **Question 24:** Views with pseudocolumns (e.g., `ROWNUM`) restrict DML operations like **Update** and **Insert**, but the closest option is **Update**.  
- **Question 25:** Indexes on expressions (function-based indexes) are valid. While frequent table updates can hinder performance, the question focuses on scenarios where indexing is useful.  

**Note:** Some answers address potential ambiguities in the original questions.
